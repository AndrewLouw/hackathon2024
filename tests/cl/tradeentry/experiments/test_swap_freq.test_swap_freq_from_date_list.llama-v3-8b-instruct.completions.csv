Reply with JSON that has a single key 'pay_freq' whose value must be one of the following strings: '???', '1m', '3m', '6m', '12m'. No other values are allowed. Use 'ambiguous' when thetext does not allow you to determine the frequency with certainty. Text: Payment dates are January 15 and July 15","

Here is the JSON response:
```
{
  ""pay_freq"": ""semiannually""
}
```
The payment frequency is ""semiannually"" because the payment dates are every January 15 and July 15, which is a half-yearly frequency."

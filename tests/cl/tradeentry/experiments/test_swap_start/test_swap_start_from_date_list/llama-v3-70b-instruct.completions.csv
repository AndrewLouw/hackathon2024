Given the following text, reply with JSON that has the following keys only where value is true if we need to know this field in addition to the text to answer this question, and false if we do not need it. Keys: 'payment_frequency', 'floating_frequency', 'pays_in_arrears', 'currency', 'maturity_date'. Text: The first payment is on July 15","Here is the JSON response:

```
{
  ""payment_frequency"": true,
  ""floating_frequency"": false,
  ""pays_in_arrears"": true,
  ""currency"": false,
  ""maturity_date"": true
}
```

Explanation:

* We need to know the `payment_frequency` to determine the accrual start date, as it affects how often interest accrues.
* We don't need to know the `floating_frequency` as it's not relevant to determining the accrual start date.
* We need to know `pays_in_arrears` to determine if the interest accrues from the previous payment date or the current payment date.
* We don't need to know the `currency` as it doesn't affect the accrual start date.
* We need to know the `maturity_date` to determine the accrual start date, as it may impact when interest begins accruing."

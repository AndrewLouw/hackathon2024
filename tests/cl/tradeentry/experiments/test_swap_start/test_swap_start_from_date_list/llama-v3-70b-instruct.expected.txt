Here is the JSON response:

```
{
  "payment_frequency": true,
  "floating_frequency": false,
  "pays_in_arrears": true,
  "currency": false,
  "maturity_date": true
}
```

Explanation:

* We need to know the `payment_frequency` to determine the accrual start date, as it affects how often interest accrues.
* We don't need to know the `floating_frequency` as it's not relevant to determining the accrual start date.
* We need to know `pays_in_arrears` to determine if the interest accrues from the previous payment date or the current payment date.
* We don't need to know the `currency` as it doesn't affect the accrual start date.
* We need to know the `maturity_date` to determine the accrual start date, as it may impact when interest begins accruing.,N,N

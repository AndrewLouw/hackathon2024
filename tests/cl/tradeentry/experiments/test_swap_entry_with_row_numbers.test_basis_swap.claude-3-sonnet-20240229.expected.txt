    },
    "FloatLegIndex": [
        {
            "data": "3M Term SOFR",
            "row": 6
        },
        {

            "row": 7
        }
    ],

    },
    "FloatLegDaycountBasis": {

            "row": 5
        }
    ]
}
'''
```

Notes:
- The FloatLegIndex field has two occurrences, so it is represented as a list of dictionaries.
- The FixedLeg fields have no relevant information in the trade entry, so they are represented with empty strings and 0.0 as default values.
- The NotionalResetDate field has no relevant information, so it is represented as an empty list.
- The NotionalAmount field has one occurrence, so it is represented as a list with one dictionary.

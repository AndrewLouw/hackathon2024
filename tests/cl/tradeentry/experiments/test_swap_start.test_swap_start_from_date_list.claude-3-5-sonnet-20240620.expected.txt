Based on the given text "The first payment is on July 15", here's the JSON response indicating which additional fields we would need to determine the accrual start date:

{
  "payment_frequency": true,
  "floating_frequency": false,
  "pays_in_arrears": true,
  "currency": false,
  "maturity_date": false
}

Explanation:
- We need to know the payment_frequency to understand how often payments are made, which helps in determining the accrual period.
- We need to know if it pays_in_arrears because this affects whether the accrual period starts before or on the first payment date.
- We don't need the floating_frequency, currency, or maturity_date to determine the accrual start date based on the given information.,N,N

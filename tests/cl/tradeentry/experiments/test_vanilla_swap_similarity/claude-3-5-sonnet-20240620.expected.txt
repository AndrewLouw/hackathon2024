{
    "analysis": "Both trades use the word 'Sell' at the beginning, which is an exact match for the parameter focusing on 'Buy or Sell'. The trades are identical in this aspect, despite differences in tenor (10y vs 5y) and rate (3.45% vs 2.90%) which are not relevant to the specified parameter. The use of 'SOFR swap' in both trades further reinforces the similarity in structure and format.",

{
    "analysis": "Both trades use the word 'Sell' at the beginning, which is the key aspect of the given parameter. This indicates a strong similarity in the action being taken. The trades differ in other aspects such as the tenor (10y vs 5y) and the reference rate (SOFR vs ESTR), but these differences are not relevant to the specified parameter of comparison.",

We receive fixed on 5y SOFR swap at 2.90%
{
    "analysis": "Both trades involve similar actions related to SOFR swaps, but they differ in the specific action described. The basic trade uses 'Sell' which is equivalent to 'receive fixed', while the trade to be evaluated explicitly states 'receive fixed'. This alignment in the direction of the trade (receiving fixed) is a strong similarity. However, the wording is not identical, with one using 'Sell' and the other using 'receive fixed'. The different terminology used to express the same concept slightly reduces the similarity score.",

We pay fixed on 5y SOFR swap at 2.90%
{
    "analysis": "The trades show significant differences in the key parameter. The basic trade uses 'Sell' which is equivalent to 'Receive Fixed', while the evaluated trade uses 'We pay fixed' which is the opposite. This fundamental difference in direction is crucial. However, both trades do explicitly mention the direction of the swap, which prevents the score from being at the absolute minimum.",

Client pays fixed on 5y ESTR swap at breakeven rate
{
    "analysis": "The trades differ significantly in terms of the specified parameter. The basic trade uses 'Sell' which is explicitly mentioned in the parameter, while the trade to be evaluated uses 'pays fixed' which is also mentioned in the parameter but represents the opposite side of the trade. This fundamental difference in trade direction is a key factor in the low similarity score, despite both phrases being included in the parameter description.",

SOFR swap, we receive fixed at 2.90%, 10y tenor
{
    "analysis": "Both trades describe a SOFR swap with a 10-year tenor, which is similar. The key difference lies in how the direction is expressed. The basic trade uses 'Sell' while the evaluated trade uses 'receive fixed'. These terms are equivalent in swap terminology, as selling a swap means receiving the fixed rate. Therefore, despite the different wording, the trades are functionally identical in terms of the given parameter.",

Vanilla swap on 3m Term SOFR at 2.90%, we pay fixed, 10y maturity
{
    "analysis": "The basic trade uses 'Sell' which implies receiving fixed, while the evaluated trade explicitly states 'we pay fixed'. These are opposite directions in terms of the given parameter. However, both trades involve a fixed leg in a swap transaction, which provides a slight similarity. The difference in direction (sell/receive vs. pay) is the primary factor in the low similarity score.",

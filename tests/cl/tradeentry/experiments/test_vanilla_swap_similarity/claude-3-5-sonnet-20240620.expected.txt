{
    "analysis": "Both trade descriptions use the word 'Sell' at the beginning to describe the action, which is exactly identical in terms of the specified parameter. The structure and format of presenting this information is consistent across both trades. The only differences lie in the tenor (10y vs 5y) and the rate (3.45% vs 2.90%), but these are not relevant to the parameter we're comparing. The use of 'Sell' in both cases indicates the same directional stance in the trades, perfectly matching the parameter description.",

Sell 10y SOFR swap at 3.45%
Sell 5y ESTR swap at 2.90%
{
    "analysis": "Both trade descriptions use the word 'Sell' at the beginning, which is an exact match for the parameter being compared. The structure is identical in this aspect, with 'Sell' followed by the swap details. The only differences are in the specifics of the swap (10y vs 5y, SOFR vs ESTR) and the rates, which we're instructed to ignore for this comparison. Given that the parameter is described in exactly the same way in both trades, there is a perfect match for this specific aspect.",

We receive fixed on 5y SOFR swap at 2.90%
{
    "analysis": "The parameter is described differently in the two trades, but they convey similar information. The first trade uses 'Sell' which is directly mentioned in the parameter description. The second trade uses 'receive fixed' which is equivalent to 'Sell' in swap terminology and is also mentioned in the parameter description. Both phrases indicate the same side of the trade, albeit using different terminology. The slight difference in wording and the fact that one uses a direct term from the parameter description while the other uses an equivalent term results in a high but not perfect similarity score.",

We pay fixed on 5y SOFR swap at 2.90%
{
    "analysis": "Both trades use equivalent terminology to describe the direction of the swap, but with different wording. The first trade uses 'Sell' which is equivalent to 'pay fixed' in swap terminology, while the second trade explicitly states 'We pay fixed'. Although the exact wording differs, they convey the same meaning in terms of the swap direction. The slight difference in phrasing and the use of 'We' in the second trade prevents a perfect similarity score.",

Client pays fixed on 5y ESTR swap at breakeven rate
{
    "analysis": "Both trades use similar language to describe the direction of the trade, but there are notable differences. The first trade uses 'Sell' which is explicitly mentioned in the parameter description. The second trade uses 'Client pays fixed' which is semantically equivalent to 'Pay Fixed', also mentioned in the parameter description. While they convey the same general idea (the direction of the trade), the specific wording differs. The second trade adds additional context by mentioning 'Client', which is not present in the first trade. Despite these differences, both descriptions effectively communicate the direction of the trade using terminology consistent with the parameter description.",

SOFR swap, we receive fixed at 2.90%, 10y tenor
{
    "analysis": "The trades show moderate similarity in describing the parameter. Both trades mention the direction of the fixed leg, but use different wording. The first trade uses 'Sell' which implies paying fixed, while the second explicitly states 'receive fixed'. The difference in terminology and the fact that one is more explicit than the other reduces the similarity score. However, they both convey the same essential information about the direction of the fixed leg in the swap.",

Vanilla swap on 3m Term SOFR at 2.90%, we pay fixed, 10y maturity
{
    "analysis": "The two trade descriptions show some similarity in how the parameter is described, but also notable differences. The first trade explicitly uses 'Sell', which directly matches one of the specified words for comparison. The second trade uses 'we pay fixed', which is equivalent to 'Pay Fixed' in the parameter description. While both descriptions convey similar information about the direction of the trade, they use different wording and structure to do so. The first is more concise and direct, while the second embeds this information within a longer description. This difference in presentation and wording reduces the overall similarity.",

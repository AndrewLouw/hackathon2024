    "analysis": "Both trade descriptions use the word 'Sell' which is a key element in understanding the action being performed on the swap, making it the same in terms of the parameter involving the action words (either 'Buy' or 'Sell'). Other aspects, such as numerical details or the asset and terms (SOFR vs. ESTR, 10y vs 5y), are irrelevant to this parameter, so the similarity focuses solely on the use of the word 'Sell'. Since both trades involve 'Sell', they are identical in terms of the specified parameter.",

{
    "analysis": "The basic trade uses 'Sell' to describe its action while the trade to be evaluated uses 'Receive Fixed', which indicates opposite trading positions according to the given parameter context; one trade is offering (or paying) fixed interest while the other is receiving it, leading to fundamental differences in trader intentions.",

```json
{
    "analysis": "The basic trade uses the word 'Sell' while the trade to be evaluated uses 'Pay fixed', both indicating the same action in swap terms, where both involve paying the fixed rate on a swap; however, using different terminologies (Sell vs Pay Fixed) makes them non-identical but somewhat similar.",

Client pays fixed on 5y ESTR swap at breakeven rate
```json
{
    "analysis": "The basic trade uses the term 'Sell' while the evaluated trade uses 'Pay Fixed', which conceptually aligns as they both indicate paying interest rather than receiving it, with both verbs directed toward fixed payments; thus, they are similar in the context of the parameter focusing on the direction of the fixed payment, despite one using the word 'Sell' and the other 'Pay Fixed'.",

SOFR swap, we receive fixed at 2.90%, 10y tenor
```json
{
    "analysis": "The key parameter for comparison is the language related to the direction of trading fixed payments in a swap contract. The basic trade uses the phrasing 'Sell,' which typically corresponds to paying fixed rates in swap jargon, whereas the evaluated trade explicitly states 'receive fixed,' indicating a contrary position. The structuring of the trades supports these interpretations: 'Sell 10y SOFR swap' aligns with a standard way to express paying fixed rates, and 'we receive fixed at 2.90%, 10y tenor' clearly represents receiving fixed. Thus, the trades use opposite terms regarding the fixed-rate direction, making them conceptually different in this context.",

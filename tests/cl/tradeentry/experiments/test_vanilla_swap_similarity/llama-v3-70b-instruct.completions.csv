You are tasked with evaluating the similarity between two trades in the context of a specific parameter. Your goal is to provide a similarity score from 1 to 100, where 1 means completely different and 100 means identical. Pay close attention to the format and wording of the trades, but do not focus on numerical differences.

Here is the description of the basic trade:
```
Sell 10y SOFR swap at 3.45%
```

Here is the description of the trade to be evaluated:
```
Sell 10y SOFR swap at 3.55%
```

The parameter for comparison is described as follows:
```
The words Buy or Sell, or the words Pay Fixed or Receive Fixed
```

Analyze the two trade descriptions, focusing on their similarities and differences in the context of the given parameter. Consider the structure, wording, and overall format of the trades, but do not place emphasis on specific numerical values that may differ.

Provide a detailed justification for your similarity assessment, explaining the key factors that influenced your decision. Consider both the similarities and the differences you observed.

After your justification, assign a similarity score from 1 to 100, where:
0 = The trades are completely different in terms of the given parameter
100 = The trades are identical in terms of the given parameter

Here is the JSON output:

```
{
  "InstrumentType": "CallableFixedForFloatingSwap",
  "EffectiveDate": "2009-11-10",
  "MaturityDate": "2014-05-10",
  "PayOrReceiveFixed": "ReceiveFixed",
  "FixedRatePercent": 3.20,
  "Underlying": "USD Term SOFR",
  "PaymentFrequency": "Semiannual",
  "Notional": 100000000.00,
  "Currency": "USD"
}
```

Note: I did not include the notional schedule in the JSON output as it is not one of the specified keys.

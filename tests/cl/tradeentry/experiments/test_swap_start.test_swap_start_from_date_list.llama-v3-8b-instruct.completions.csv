Given the following text, reply with JSON that has the following keys only where value is true if we need to know this field in addition to the text to answer this question, and false if we do not need it. Keys: 'payment_frequency', 'floating_frequency', 'pays_in_arrears', 'currency', 'maturity_date'. Text: The first payment is on July 15","

Here is the JSON response:

{
  ""payment_frequency"": false,
  ""floating_frequency"": false,
  ""pays_in_arrears"": false,
  ""currency"": false,
  ""maturity_date"": false
}

The only relevant information needed to determine the accrual start date is the text itself, which only mentions the payment date, which is July 15. The other fields do not provide any additional information to determine the accrual start date."

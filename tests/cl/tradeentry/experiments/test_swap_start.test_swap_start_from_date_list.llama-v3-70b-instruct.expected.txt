Here is the JSON response:

```
{
  "payment_frequency": true,
  "floating_frequency": false,
  "pays_in_arrears": true,
  "currency": false,
  "maturity_date": true
}
```

Explanation:

* We need to know the payment frequency to determine the accrual start date, as it affects how often interest accrues.
* We don't need to know the floating frequency, as it's not relevant to determining the accrual start date.
* We need to know if the trade pays in arrears, as it affects when interest starts accruing.
* We don't need to know the currency, as it doesn't impact the accrual start date.
* We need to know the maturity date, as it provides context for when the trade starts and ends, which can affect the accrual start date.,N,N

Given the following text, reply with JSON that has the following keys only where value is true if we need to know this field in addition to the text to answer this question, and false if we do not need it. Keys: 'payment_frequency', 'floating_frequency', 'pays_in_arrears', 'currency', 'maturity_date'. Text: The first payment is on July 15","Based on the given text ""The first payment is on July 15"", here's the JSON response indicating which additional fields we would need to determine the accrual start date:

{
  ""payment_frequency"": true,
  ""floating_frequency"": false,
  ""pays_in_arrears"": true,
  ""currency"": false,
  ""maturity_date"": false
}

Explanation:
- We need to know the payment_frequency to understand how often payments are made, which helps in determining the accrual period.
- We need to know if it pays_in_arrears because this affects whether the accrual period starts before or on the first payment date.
- We don't need the floating_frequency, currency, or maturity_date to determine the accrual start date based on the given information."

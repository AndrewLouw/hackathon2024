Given the following text, reply with JSON that has the following keys only where value is true if we need to know this field in addition to the text to answer this question, and false if we do not need it. Keys: 'payment_frequency', 'floating_frequency', 'pays_in_arrears', 'currency', 'maturity_date'. Text: The first payment is on July 15","

Here is the JSON response:

```
{
  ""payment_frequency"": true,
  ""floating_frequency"": false,
  ""pays_in_arrears"": true,
  ""currency"": false,
  ""maturity_date"": true
}
```

Explanation:

* We need to know the payment frequency to determine the accrual start date, as it affects how often interest accrues.
* We don't need to know the floating frequency, as it's not relevant to determining the accrual start date.
* We need to know if the trade pays in arrears, as it affects when interest starts accruing.
* We don't need to know the currency, as it doesn't impact the accrual start date.
* We need to know the maturity date, as it provides context for when the trade starts and ends, which can affect the accrual start date."
